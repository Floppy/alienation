Alienation 0.0.4
----------------

Linux:
------

To build the Alienation executable, run the following commands:

   ./configure
   make

You will need the development packages installed for the SDL, 
SDL_image and SDL_mixer libraries installed. configure will complain
if you don't have them so just go ahead and try it ;)

Once make has completed, you can run the demo by typing

  ./Alienation

You will need to be in the top-level source directory to do this, 
otherwise it won't find the data files.

Enjoy!


Windows:
--------

You can build Alienation in Visual Studio, but you'll need to install 
the SDL, SDL_image and SDL_mixer libraries into your include and library
paths.
